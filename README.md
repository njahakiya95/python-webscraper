# Python Weather Scraper

weather-scraper.py takes a user input location (Lat/Lon Coordinates, City Name, Zip Code) 
and outputs the current time, temperature, humidity, wind, and chance of precipitation. 

If no input location is provided, the default location is the IP of the computer being used to run the code.

Furthermore, it also prints the 7 day forecast, along with the high/low temperature for each day. 

Google weather is used to perform the data scraping

To run the code, simple clone the repository and run the following command from your terminal ("location" is optional)
```
$ python3 weather-scraper.py <location>

```
